# How to Solve Quadratic Equations

## What a Quadratic Equation is
A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree two, meaning the highest power of the variable is two. The standard form of a quadratic equation is ax² + bx + c = 0, where 'x' is the variable and 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants, with the crucial condition that a cannot be zero (a ≠ 0).
