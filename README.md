# How to Solve Quadratic Equations in Python

## Introduction  
Quadratic equations appear in many areas such as physics, engineering, and finance. They follow the form:  

\[
`ax^2 + bx + c = 0`
\]  

The quadratic formula gives us the solutions (roots):  

\[
`ax^2 + bx + c = 0`
\]  

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll write a simple Python program that solves quadratic equations step by step.

## Step 1: Import the Math Library  
We need the `math` library for the square root function.  

```python
import math
